    <p class="page-1-text">F1 is the world's most prestigious automotive race where teams from all over the world can participate, their challenge is to build a car that can squeeze the most amount of power from a 1.6 liter V6 engine in order to win they must also keep in mind aerodynamic. While when F1 start they only thing that matter was how much power an engine can generate, now aerodynamic plays a more important role. Since all the cars in F1 produce nearly the same amount of power teams need to focus on increasing the downforce on the cars, the cars can travel at a faster rate through the corners. .</p>

Generally, in the past, regulations went in the direction of slowing down the cars. However, this year, the rule changes go in the opposite direction, meaning the cars have more aerodynamic downforce and more mechanical grip</p>
